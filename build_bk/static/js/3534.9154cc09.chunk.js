Even with such small odds, this could be a well-priced bet if you believe the outcome is virtually certain.","Some position sizing systems will recommend a large bet if you have a very high forecast probability.

Psychology is very important in betting (and investing) and if you feel uncomfortable with the volatility in your betting returns it will impact on your ability to maintain the discipline necessary for a successful betting system. Maintaining a disciplined approach to position sizing when you have lost your nerve, or alternatively when you are feeling invincible, is very challenging. All punters have great runs where they feel unbeatable and believe they may just have discovered the secret to free money. And all punters also have periods where nothing goes right and they feel like giving up. Never underestimate the impact of luck on your short term returns. Ensuring you operate within your risk tolerance will help you stay focused. Everyone goes into betting hoping to win or at least break even but many people don\u2019t. So how much are you prepared to lose? How do you feel when you lose half of your book? These considerations and others feed into the determination of your standard bet size which in turn determines how fast you could lose your money.
